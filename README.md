# ML-to-predict-loan-performance

This is the final project for 554.488/688: Financial Computing I, at Johns Hopkins University, in the Applied Maths & Statistics Department. 

The goal is to use past data from the Federal National Mortgage Association (commonly known as Fannie Mae) to create Machine Learning models to predict loan duration and loan revenues. 

You may find the [problem statement](https://github.com/puigruizjosep1/ML-to-predict-loan-performance/blob/master/Problem%20Statement.pdf), the [data](http://jesse.ams.jhu.edu/~dan/FNMA/FinalAssignment/), [the code](https://github.com/puigruizjosep1/ML-to-predict-loan-performance/blob/master/Code/FinalProjectJosep.ipynb), and the [final report](https://github.com/puigruizjosep1/ML-to-predict-loan-performance/blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf) here.
